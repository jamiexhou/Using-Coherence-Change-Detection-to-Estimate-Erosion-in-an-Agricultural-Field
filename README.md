# Using-Coherence-Change-Detection-to-Estimate-Erosion-in-an-Agricultural-Field

Erosion on farms is an important thing to consider when figuring out how to feed an ever growing population. Eroded soil is less fertile and can even damage local ecosystems. This study aims to estimate erosion using radar satellite imagery products to estimate the location and quantities of erosion. However, it was unsuccessful. Likely due to the limitations of resolution and the existence of vegetation.

Special thanks to Dr. Derek Robinson from the University of Waterloo for overseeing this project!
